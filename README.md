## About

Th header was done by creating a header class to put all the header stuff: My name, about | portfolio | contact in. I made a class for the Your Name box and 2 classes for the about | portfolio | contact. (Though I realized I could just make 1 class and just slightly tweak the last one so it doesn't have a border-right). I then used a border-bottom as a separator. I adjusted the margins so it looks the same as the assigment description. 

I then made another box called content-box which will be also used in the next 2 pages for the center section. I assigned absolute to the contentbox's position because I didn't want it to be affected much, then I was able to create h1 and p classes to better format the text and image. I used margins and paddings so that it comes out to fit assignment descriptions. 

The footer was done rather brute forcedly, since I mainly made a box and shoved it down to the bottom so it looks right. Hopefully I would be more skilled later on so I wouldn't have to do something so primitive feeling.


## Portfolio

Using the template from work done on the About page, this page was done rather quickly by fiddling with more boxes and positions. I kept the images as relative and the labels of each image as absolute. I split the label class into 5 so that I can individually place them. 

## Contact

The contacts page was the simplest page for this assignment as most input textboxes could be quickly done after reading about it on w3schools. I was able to modify the textboxes, textarea, and the submit button so it fits the assignment description.
